# General-Cipher-Solver
Applying the genetic algorithm to solve any cipher. 

Instead of having to write a whole solver for a cipher, you only have to write functions to:
[ ] - randomly initialise a key
[ ] - decode the text given the key
[ ] - randomly mutate the key
[ ] - crossover two keys (optional but improves performance)

Once this is done, sit back and watch the [BLAZINGLY FAST](https://programmerhumor.io/rust-memes/rust-is-blazingly-fast-and-we-wont-shut-up-about-it-f24q) parallelised solver ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
